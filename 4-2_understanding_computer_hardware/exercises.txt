Explorational Exercises

1. run the lsblk command on your system. Identify the parameters below. If a system is not immediately available, consider the lsblk -f listing for the Raspberry Pi system mentioned in the "Storage" section above:

a) The type of devices and how many
I have three devices on my system: sda, sdb and nvme

b) The partition structure of each device
disk 1 (sda) has four partitions, disk 2 has three partitions and nvme has one partition.

c) The type of file system and mount for each partition
sda1 vfat
sda2 raw
sda3 ntfs
sda4 ntfs

sdb1 vfat
sdb2 ext4
sdb3 btrfs

nvme0n1p1 ntfs
