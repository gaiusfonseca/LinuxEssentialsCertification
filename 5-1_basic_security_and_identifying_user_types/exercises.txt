1. Consider the following outpu of the id command:
$id emma
In which files are the following attributes stored?
	UID and GIP: Theses attributes are stored in /etc/passwd
	Groups: This attribute is detailed in file /etc/group

2. Which of the following types of cryptograpgy is used by default to store passwords locally on a Linux system?
One-way Hash

3. If an account has a User ID (UID) enumerated under 1000, what type of account is this?
It is a System Account.

4. How can you get a list of the active logins in your system, and a count of them as well?
List active logins:
$who

count of active logins:
$who --count

5. Using the grep command, we got the result below with information about the user emma.
grep emma /etc/passwd

Fill in the blanks of the chart with the appropriate information usin the output of the previous command.
Username: emma
Password: x
UID: 1000
Primary GID: 1000
GECOS: Emma Smith, 42 Douglas St, 555.555.5555
Home Directory: /home/emma
Shell: /bin/bash

Explorational Exercises
1. Compare the results of last to w and who. What details are missing from each of the commands compared to one another?
last
shows who logged in since the creation of the log file
username, date, session duration

who
shows who is logged in now
username, date, method

w
shows who is logged in now and what they are doing
username, tty, login at, idle, jcpu, pcpu, what

2. Try issuing the commands who and w -his
- What information has beem removed from the output of the w command with the "no header" (-h) and "short" (-s) options?
No header removes the column headers. Short removes information about the workload.

- What information has been added in the output the w command with the "ip address" (-i) option?
-i adds the column FROM to the output. I think it shows the ip addres in case it is a remote access.

3. Which file is the file that stores a user account's one-way password hash?
It is stored in /etc/shadow

4. Which file contains the list of groups a user account is a member of? What logic could be used to compile a list of a groups a user account is a member of?
The file that contains the groups a user belongs to is the /etc/group. We could issue one of the following commands:
$id --groups --name username
$grep username /etc/group

5. One or more (1+) of the following file are not readable by regular, unprivileged ursers, by default. Which ones?
/etc/group - regular user can read
/etc/passwd - regular user can read
/etc/shadow - regular user can't read, only root can read
/etc/sudoers - regular user can't read, only root can read

6. How would you change the current user's login shell to the Korn Shell (/usr/bin/ksh) in non-interactive mode?
We can change in non interactive mode issuing the following command:
$ chsh -s /usr/bin/ksh

7. Why is the home directory of the root user not placed within /home directory?
because it is only readable an writable by the root user, shich is a Super User.
