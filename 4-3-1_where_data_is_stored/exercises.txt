Explorational Exercises

1. Device files for hard drives are represented based on the controllers they use - we saw /dev/sd* for drives using SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) and SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment), but:

a) How were old IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) drives represented?
Old IDE drives are represented with the prefix 'hd'

b) And modern NVMe (Non-Volatile memory Express) drives?
NVMe are represented with the prefix nvme

2. Take a look at the file /proc/meminfo. Compare the contents of this file to the output of the command free and identify which key from /proc/meminfo correspond to the following fields in the output of free:

free output		/proc/meminfo field
total			MemTotal + SwapTotal
free			MemFree + SwapFree
shared			Shmem	
buff/cache		Buffers + Cached + SReclaimable
available		MemAvailable
