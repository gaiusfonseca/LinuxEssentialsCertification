Guided Exercises


1. For each of the following paths, identify whether it is absolute or relative:

a) /home/user/Downloads - 	absolute path
b) ../Reports - 		relative path
c) /var - 			absolute path
d) docs - 			relative path
e) / - 				absolute path


2. Observe the following file structure. Note: Directories end with a slash (/) when tree is invoked with the -F option. You will need elevated privileges in order to run the tree command on the root (/) directory. The following is example output and is not indicative of a full directory structure. Use it to answer the following questions:

a) A user enter the following commands:
"cd /etc/udev"
"ls -a"

.
..
rules.d/
udev.conf


3. Enter the shortest possible command for each of the following:

a) Your current location is root (/). Enter the command to navigate to "lost+found" within the home directory:
"cd ~/lost+found"

b) Your current location is root (/). Enter the command to navigate to "/etc/network":
"cd /etc/network"

c) Your current location is /home/user/Documents/. Navigate to the directory named /etc/
"cd /etc"

d) Your current location is /etc/systemd/system/. Navigate to the directory named /home/user
"cd ~"


4. Consider the following commands:
"$ pwd"
"/etc/udev/rules.d"
"$ cd ../../systemd/user"
"$ cd .."
"$ pwd

"/etc/systemd"
